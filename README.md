# Sorting_Algorithms

I used Java Language to create some of the popular Sorting Algorithms with Array Data Structure. I have created Insertion Sort, Merge Sort and Binary Search algorithms. Also, I used Object-Oriented Programming in the process.


Learning Outcome :
 I have gained a better understanding on how the sorting algorithms work which will help me in the future for more ease of programming.
